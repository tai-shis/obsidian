#### Integration of Computer Science Principles
- algorithms for complex programs
- languages from CS, apply to SE
- SE applies AI and ML to create "smarter" systems
#### Integration of Computer Engineering Principles
- system design to create software that works well with hardware
- Strict testing methods similar to computer engineering to maintain reliability
#### Integration of Information Systems Principles
- uses IS methods to understand/document user needs for development
- uses similar skills to manage budgets, timelines, and resources for larger projects
- similar focus by creating intuitive/accessible software to enhance uex
#### Integration of Information Technology Principles
- adoption of IT practices to plan/deploy software smoothly
- prioritization of secure software design and consistent management/maintenance for long-term reliability
- requires understanding of IT environments to ensure software compatibility and performance
#### Discipline vs Field of Study
- **Discipline**
	- specific branch of knowledge/area of specialization
- **Field**
	- wider scope
	- includes various sub-disciplines, research areas, practices, and applications
#### General Information
- SE is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software
- *The application of a systematic, disciplined, and **quantifiable approach** to the development, operation, and maintenance of software*
- ##### Quantifiable Approach
	- refers to the *use of measurable and objective methods in the software engineering process*
	- I.e. Software engineers rely on metrics and data to evaluate the quality, performance, and progress of their work at every stage of development
	- General Metrics:
		- Timeliness
			- measurement of progression according to the schedule
		- Reliability
			- how often software crashes/encounters errors
		- Performance
			- measuring the speed, memory usage, responsiveness of the software
		- User Satisfaction
			- gathering data on how well the software meets expectations
			- uex
			- needs, feedback, usability, etc.
	- *Example of quantifiable approach:*
		- Timeliness
			- sets a goal of a timeline
			- break down development into smaller "milestones"
				- completing design
				- making prototype
				- etc.
		- Reliability
			- measuring failure rates
			- goal of reliability statistic
			- using statistic **set beforehand** to see when things need to be adjusted
	- Great to allow teams/groups to **identify problems early** and adjust to ensure product meets expectations/requirements
#### Importance of Software Engineering
- Focus is **problem-solving, not puzzle-solving**
	- puzzle solving emphasizes finding solutions to well-defined *isolated* challenges
	- problem solving addresses issues to create a broader solution to a problem
- Software Engineers require more skills than just coding, such as:
	- *Communicating* with stakeholders
	- Translate needs into requirements
	- Design reliable systems
	- **Test thoroughly**
- **Meeting User Needs**
	- Balance of technical skills and user-focused design is required, done by:
		- Understanding **user needs**
			- recognizing user interaction and how the user experience can be improved
		- Iterating with feedback
			- regularly gathering user feedback to improve/refine the product
- Ensuring Reliability and **Scalability**
	- solve current problems and is reliable and ready for **future needs**
	- create software that can grow/handle more users or data without issues
- SE will be used to apply a structured scientific/engineering approach to every phase of the software development lifecycle
	- analysis, design, coding, testing, maintenance, etc.
#### Systematic Problem Solving in Engineering
- **Core principles**
	- breaking down complex problems into manageable parts
- **Civil engineers**
	- designing bridges by considering materials, load-bearing capacity, environmental factors
- **Software Engineers**
	- dividing software into key components like design, functionality, performance, and scalability
- Breaking down complex software problems
	- e.g. e-commerce platform involves breaking it down into key components
		- user auth
		- product catalog management
		- payment tracking
		- order tracking
		- etc.
	- Each component will be solved individually before bringing it together
- Project Management in Software Engineering
	- ensures projects are delivered on time, in budget, and to specs
	- requires more than code quality like effective coordination and resource management
	- **this is a key factor in building reliable, scalable, and user-centric software solutions**
	- **Key  Aspects**
		- Time management
		- Phased development
		- Regular Check-Ins
		- etc.
- Design and Architecture
	- creating a plan for how the software should function
	- Key Goal:
		- Ensure the system is scalable and maintainable
	- Well designed architecture lays the foundation for reliable and efficient software
	- Importance
		- facilitates easier troubleshooting and modification
		- clear guidelines for future updates and enhancements 
- Quality Assurance
	- *follows design and coding to ensure software quality*
	- Purpose:
		- verify if software needs meet user requirements
		- ensure reliability/performance under conditions/loads
	- Unit testing
		- testing individual components
	- Integration Testing
		- testing components working together as intended
	- System Testing
		- making sure software meets function/performance standards
	- User Acceptance Testing
		- making sure software meets end-user need **before** final delivery
- Maintenance
	- Continuous Updates
		- functionality and relevance over time
	- Patching
		- fixing bugs/security vulnerabilities
	- more on notes
