### Part 1
- no notes lol

### Part 2
- *Key Stages of the Process*
	- Gathering requirements
	- Documenting details
	- Analysis and Modelling 
	- Validating Requirements 
- **Stage 1**: Gathering requirements
	- Engaging with stakeholders
		- Users/those who will be impacted by the software
			- I.e.
				- Customers
				- Business Owners 
				- Other Users
					- (people who interact with the system for maintenance)
	- Techniques:
		- Interviews 
			- with stakeholders to gather information
		- Workshops 
			- to engage with key stakeholders to discuss needs
		- Questionnaires/Surveys
			- Collecting feedback from stakeholders quickly
		- Observation
			- Watching users in their actual environment to understand what is lacking/requires improvements.
			- *Documenting hidden requirements by observing user behaviour*
- **Stage 2**: Refining and Documenting
	- *Elicitation*
		- refining and clarifying raw requirements
		- Resolving Ambiguities
		- Resolving conflicting requirements from different stakeholders
		- requirements are put into *functional* and *non-functional* types
	- Stage requirements are formally documented **(SRS)**
		- This is the blueprint for the development team
- **Stage 3**: Analyzing and Modelling/Visualizing
	- Where development team analyzes the documented requirements in detail
		- Breaking down large requirements into smaller tasks
	- Questions to ask:
		- Are the requirements feasible?
			- In given time frame, resources, technology, etc.
		- Do any requirements contradict each other?
			- Ex. one feature conflicts with the business goals of another
		- Can we break large requirements into smaller tasks?
			- Makes development easier to manage and plan
	- Modelling techniques are used in this stage *(UML)*
		- Case Diagrams
		- Flowcharts
		- Wireframes
		- These tools can help identify potential issues/disagreements early on

- **Stage 4**: Validating Requirements
	- Stakeholders review the document requirements and ensure if requirements are:
		- accurate
		- feasible
		- complete
	- Ensures stakeholders agree on requirements *before* development begins
	- Prevents **scope creep**
		- where project's requirements keep expanding leading to delays and cost.

### Part 3
missing, is about feedback and gathering data, check slides
