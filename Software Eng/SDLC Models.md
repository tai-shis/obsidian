### Waterfall SDLC
- step-by-step process for developing software
- each stage *must* be completed before moving to the next
	- completed to completion
	- no going back
- **Advantages:**
	- Clear Structure
		- all phases are distinct and well-defined
	- Documentation
		- ensures clear communication and understanding of requirements
	- Predictable Timeline
		- fixed phases makes it easier to estimate time, cost, and resources
	- Easy to Manage
		- progress is easily measurable
	- *Best for Stable Requirements*
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Inflexibility
		- hard to adapt to changes once a phase is done
	- Late Testing
		- testing happens after development
		- expensive to fix issues discovered late
	- User Feedback is Delayed
		- users wont see the product until its nearly finished
	- Risk of Obsolescence
		- long cycles can lead to outdated solutions by the time it is done
	- *Not ideal for complex or evolving projects*
- **When to use**
	- Clear and Fixed requirements
		- when goals are unlikely to change
	- Short and Simple Projects
	- High-Risk Situations
	- Clients Demand a Predictable Plan
