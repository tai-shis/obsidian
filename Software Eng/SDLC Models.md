### Key Ideas/Things
- CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
	- Circle CI
---
### Waterfall SDLC
- step-by-step process for developing software
- each stage *must* be completed before moving to the next
	- completed to completion
	- no going back
- **Advantages:**
	- Clear Structure
		- all phases are distinct and well-defined
	- Documentation
		- ensures clear communication and understanding of requirements
	- Predictable Timeline
		- fixed phases makes it easier to estimate time, cost, and resources
	- Easy to Manage
		- progress is easily measurable
	- *Best for Stable Requirements*
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Inflexibility
		- hard to adapt to changes once a phase is done
	- Late Testing
		- testing happens after development
		- expensive to fix issues discovered late
	- User Feedback is Delayed
		- users wont see the product until its nearly finished
	- Risk of Obsolescence
		- long cycles can lead to outdated solutions by the time it is done
	- *Not ideal for complex or evolving projects*
- **When to use**
	- Clear and Fixed requirements
		- when goals are unlikely to change
	- Short and Simple Projects
	- High-Risk Situations
	- Clients Demand a Predictable Plan

### Iterative Models
- Starts with a simple implementation of a small set of the software requirements
- Incremental development in iterations of waterfall method.
- **Advantages**
	- There is a working model of the system at a very early stage
		- Easier to find functional/design flaws
	- Allows for corrective measures to be taken within a limited budget
- **Disadvantages**
	- Only applicable to *large and bulky* software development projects
	- Hard to break small software system into chunks
---
### Agile Models
- *Combination of iterative and incremental process models*
	- Focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product
- Breaks the product into *small, incremental builds*
	- builds provided in iterations (called *sprints*)
- After each sprint, a working product is displayed to the customer/stakeholders
- Generally, every sprint contains the entirety of a condensed waterfall model
- Based on **adaptive software development methods**
- Focus on adaptability with *minimal upfront planning*
- Frequent testing during sprints reduces major failure risks

### Scrum Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**
	- Ordered list of *everything* that is known *that needs to be done* for the product
	- Prioritized list
	- 
- **Sprint Backlog**
	- *Set of items from the product backlog selected for the sprint*
	- Plan for delivering the product increment and realizing the sprint goal
- **Increment**
	- Sum of *all the product backlog items that have been completed*
	- Contains the value of the increments in all previous sprints

### Scrum Events
- **The Sprint**
- **Sprint Planning**
- **Daily Scrum**
- **Sprint Review**
- **Sprint Retrospective**
