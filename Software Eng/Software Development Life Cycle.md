### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
- A Structured process with planned steps to:
	- *Develop* new software products
	- *Modify*/improve existing software
- By doing this, software is built in a systematic manner and meets end user needs effectively
- Is a step-by-step process used to **design, develop**, and **test** software.
- To deliver software that will:
	- *Meet/exceed* customer expectations
	- Is completed *on time* and *within budget*

### SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
- *A comprehensive document outlining **all** requirements for design and development*
- Serves as a roadmap for the entire project lifecycle
---
### DDS (Design Document Specification)
