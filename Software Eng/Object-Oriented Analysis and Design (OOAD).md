### Different Ways to Design Software
- *Different projects use different approaches*
	- **Procedural Design**
		- step-by-step instructions (C programs)
	- **Object-Oriented Design**
		- Uses objects, classes, and relationships
			- e.g. Java, Python, C#
	- **Functional Design**
		- Pure functions and *immutability*
			- e.g. Haskell, Scala
	- **Event-Driven Design**
		- Event Handlers and Message Passing
			- e.g. JavaScript, Node.js
	- **Micro-services Architecture**
		- Breaks the system into independent services
			- e.g. Netflix, Amazon
- **Key Software Design Approaches**
	- *Test-Driven Development (TDD)*
		- Write tests first, then write code to pass the tests
		- Ensures high code reliability and bug prevention in early development
		- E.g.
			- This code shouldn't be able to do this, this this.
			- Restrictions decided **before** coding
	- *Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)*
		- System reacts to **events** rather than following a linear process
		- Good for real time processing and automation
		- **Asynchronous events**

### Object-Oriented Design
- **Why OOD?**
	- Widely Used
	- Encapsulates Complexity
		- Breaking down large systems into *manageable objects*
	- Scaleable and Maintainable
		- Easier to *reuse, extend, and modify*
	- Standard for UML and Architecture
- **Key Ideas (IMPORTANT)** 
	- we can "accurately" describe the real world as a *collection of objects* that interact with each other
	- Our system is broken down into *objects* that encapsulate both *data/attributes* and *behaviour*
- **An object can be thought of as a a tangible or abstract entity that exists and has specific *characteristics* (data) and *behaviours* (methods)**
	- We can encapsulate attributes and behaviours of an entity into an object
- e.g. *A library management system*
	- Has objects:
		- A Librarian
		- A Borrower
		- Books
- e.g. Smart Home System
	- Smart Thermostat
		- does temperature stuff
	- Smart Light
		- controls lighting
	- Smart Door Lock
		- does security stuff
	- Smart Security Camera
		- Monitors activity and records

### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
- **Definition**
	- OOAD is the process of analyzing a system by *identifying objects their interactions and designing a blueprint before implementation*
- **Two Phases**
	- Object-Oriented *Analysis* OOA
		- Identify *key entities* in the system and their interactions
		- holds objects
	- Object-Oriented *Design* OOD
		- Maps object into *read-world architecture*
		- how the objects interact with each other
	- Example:
		- Online Bookstore
			- Step 1: Find objects
				- User, book, order, payment, shopping cart
			- Step 2: Defining Relationships
				- User places an Order for a Book, and payment is processed
			- Step 3: System Architecture
				- Front end
				- Back end
				- Database
			- Step 4: UML Diagrams for Design and Architecture
	- ***How OOAD Connects to SRS and DDS* (important)
		- Transforms *high-level requirements (SRS) into structured design (DDS) ensuring a clear blueprint before development*
		- *Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)* acts as the *bridge between requirements and actual implementation*
- **Steps:**
	- Step 1: *Start with the Software Requirements Specification (SRS)*
		- Define Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements
			- e.g. 
				- User must be able to browse books, add to cart, place orders
				- Orders must track book details, prices, user information
				- Payments must be secure and support multiple methods
				- System can handle 100,000 concurrent users
		Step 2: *Identifying Key Objects*
		- low-level explained objects turn into:
			- Book
				- title, author, price, getDetails()
			- Shopping Cart
				- items, addItem(), removeItem()
			- etc.
	- Step 3: *Structuring the System*
		- Convert identified objects into classes, define interactions, and establish relationships
	- Step 4: *Translating OOD into a Design Document Specification (DDS)*
		- dds defines how the system will be implemented
		- focuses on architecture, UML diagrams, and technical decisions
	- Step 5: *Connecting OOAD, SRS, DDS to Software Architecture*
		- SRS: Defines what the systems must do
		- etc. he fucking switched it immediately
