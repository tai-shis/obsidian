### Software Design
- *Process of defining architecture components, interfaces, and characteristics of a system/component*
	- Also is the result of this process
- **Definition:**
	- *Software design is the process of planning how a system will work before writing code. Which also involves:*
		- Breaking a system into parts (components)
		- Defining how they interact   (interfaces)
		- Ensuring the system is *efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain*
	- Example: *Designing an online shopping website, before coding, plan out:*
		- What pages will exist?       (e.g. Home, Cart, Checkout)
		- How do the pages connect?    (e.g. Clicking "Add to Cart" updates the cart)
		- What data is needed?         (e.g. Product Prices, User Login Details)

### Architecture
- The *overall structure* of a system
- Example:
	- Blueprint of a house, deciding where rooms, doors, windows go.
- Refers to the *high-level structure* of a software system.
	- Defines how components are organized, interact, and communicate
	- Establishes the system's design principles, scalability, security, performance requirements early.
- *Why is Architecture important?*
	- well-designed architecture ensures:
		- scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient communication between components
	- poorly-designed architecture might result in:
		- slow performance, difficult maintenance, and system failures under load
	- Software architecture is the *foundation of a system.*
- ***Architecture bridges SRS and DDS** ensuring a **structured, scalable, and maintainable** software system*

### Modelling
- *A simplified representation of something in the real world*
	- used for the purpose of understanding and having the features of that reality
- Models are not just diagrams
	- Includes:
		- Text documents                   (SRS, DDS)
		- Diagrams & Visual Representation (UML diagrams, flowcharts)
		- Tables, Charts, and structured lists to organize information
	- **They are text and visual**
- *Sub-Models*
	- Complex Systems are often broken into smaller models
	- Each sub-model focuses on a specific part of a system
		- e.g. UI design, database structure, etc.
	- *Each sub-model fits together to make the full system model.
- Visual Models
	- Helps teams *see* how the system will work before building it
	- Makes complex models *easier to understand and explain
	- Ensures everyone is on the same page
	- Common Visual Models:
		- Diagrams
		- Wire frames
		- Data Models
	- **Key Takeaway**
		- *Good design starts with clear models*
		- *These help teams plan, communicate, and build better software*
- SRS and DDS are essentially both models
	- SRS as a model
		- Written Components
			- Client stories
			- functional/non-functional requirements
			- system constraints
		- Visual Components
			- use case diagrams to show interaction between users and system
	- DDS as a model
		- Written Components
			- Descriptions of architecture, data structure, and interactions
		- Visual Components
			- UML Diagrams
			- Database Schematics
			- System Workflows
	- **Key Takeaway**
		- *SRS and DDS are both models*
		- *They bridge the gap between system requirements and implementation*
			- Through **text-based** and **visual representations
