### Preface
- This section is interesting for the use case of analyzing pandas datasets
	- (I've read [this](https://madewithml.com/courses/foundations/pandas/) already before)
- Contains information on:
	- Loading data
		- (we've done this already many times)
	- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
		- analyzing/exploring data to find patterns/interesting information
		- Do this through  `.describe()` or `.hist()`
	- Filtering
		- filtering through data for specific points
	- Sorting
		- in this section, just for visualization
		- in the other sections there is a way to change the data in a sorted fashion
	- Grouping
		- also visualization
	- Indexing
		- self-explanatory
	- Preprocessing
		- this is where we drop `NaN`s and reset the index for iteration
		- we can also drop unnecessary data before inputting into our model
	- Feature Engineering
		- using `.apply()` to create new rows etc. automatically
			- applies a function to the whole dataset
	- Saving Data
		- `.to_csv("filename")`
	- Scaling
		- using Dask/cuDF to distribute workloads and run more efficiently
