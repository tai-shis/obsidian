### Summary
- **A lot of this page covers how to manipulate `NaN` values
- Additionally, how to add values (mapping) without hard coding all values in the dataset
	- The map function
- The Cut function
	- We can categorize a dataset into "buckets" of data that we define
	- For example, a set of numbers can be put into buckets of a certain range
	- see [Discretization - Cut Function](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/data-preparation-with-pandas)
- *One-Hot Encoding*
	- This is probably important for ML applications
	- Not really sure how to explain it, just see [Dummy Variables and One-Hot Encodings](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/data-preparation-with-pandas)
