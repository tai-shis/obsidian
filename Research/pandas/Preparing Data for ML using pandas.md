### Essentials for ML Data Preparation
- [List of topics](https://medium.com/@HalderNilimesh/a-comprehensive-guide-to-preparing-data-for-machine-learning-using-python-and-pandas-86e8ad65a616)
- Data Cleaning
	- finding and correcting errors in the dataset
- Missing Values
	- `NaN` values
- Outliers
	- stats methods
- Data Integration
	- concatenating multiple DataFrames and cleaning up any duplicates/missing values
- **Data Transformation**
	- converting data into a format *more appropriate for ML models*
	- scaling, normalization and standardization, encoding categorical variables, creating features
- Feature Scaling
	- dealing with features that have different scales
	- important for ML algorithms since numerical input on similar scales lead to better results
		- *scaling features to a range between 0 and 1
	- `apply()` function to fix it
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**
	- *turning non-numerical, "categorical" variables into a numerical format*
	- `get_dummies()` function for one-hot encoding
- Data Reduction
	- reducing large datasets to be resource efficient while preserving its integrity
	- we can use Scikit-learn to do this
