### #1 Defense Strategies for Epidemic Cyber Security Threats
[Defense Strategies for Epidemic Cyber Security Threats: Modelling and Analysis by Using a Machine Learning Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380585)
I may repeat a lot of things
- **From Abstract**
	- focuses on a multi-device systems targeting cybercrime attacks
	- *Utilizes a SEIAR compartmental model*
		- Susceptible(total)
		- Exposed
		- Infected
		- Asymptomatic
		- Recovered
	- The differential equations and *numerical solutions* of the models are calculated using *backpropagated Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (BLMA)* or also known as *damped least-squares* method (DLS)
	- Optimization algorithm used is the *Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA)
	- Compared to other solutions that were obtained using RK-4 algorithm
		- for sustainability concerns?
- High artificial neural network (ANN) concentration
	- A network of interconnected neurons that analyse several inputs to generate one singular output
	- Integrates multi-layer perceptron to optimize number of hidden units (also known as FNN)
- Mathematical Model solutions solved using a deep learning-based approach
- (REPEAT) *High focus on propagation/control of "cybercrime assaults" on multiple devices linked to a server*
- (this comes up frequently) Relating cybercrime assault behaviour and dynamics to epidemiology (contagious illnesses)
- **Paper focuses mainly on modelling based on DDoS attacks**
- Model general info: (may be useful later)
	- Uses one hidden layer for each input/output
	- Training data:   (70%)
	- Validation data: (15%)
	- Testing data:    (15%)
	- 10 to 20 hidden neurons
- In the SEIAR model:
	- Susceptible devices are Exposed which then can enter a state of being Infected
	- Once Infected, they are can additionally be asymptomatic which essentially mean they are in a dormant state, i.e. not showing any "symptoms", yet still infected
- They talk about "previous" model and their solutions using three optimization techniques
- Here, they focus on ANNs, their deep learning methodization and use of activation functions, alongside their input, hidden, and output layers
- Backpropagation to refine and minimize error
	- using `nftool` in MATLAB
- *Section on COVID-19 relation to malware epidemiology? See **V. Discussion** for details
- Most likely some more sections that may require more review but this is the general details on the model and how it was created/optimized

### #2 Modeling self-propagating malware with epidemiological models
[Modeling self-propagating malware with epidemiological models](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-023-00578-z)
- Focus on Self-Propagating Malware (duh) (SPM)
	- Malware that copies itself onto other systems (viruses and worms)
- Polymorphic Malware is a kind of self-propagating malware
- *Utilizes a SSIDR epidemiological model*
	- In a Non-Linear Dynamical System (NLDS)
	- Susceptible
	- Infected
	- Infected-Dormant
	- Recovered
- Hard focus on modelling the *WannaCry* malware and how/why the SSIDR model is the best fit for it compared to other more commonly used epidemiologic models
	- Also mentions other notable examples like the *Colonial Pipeline* and *Peyta*
	- This is presented in the context of *modelling SPM propagation*
- This paper also *relates computer viruses to the behaviour of biological viruses*, leveraging this to build effective epidemiological models
- Mentions the *graph-like structure exhibited by computer networks*
	- Where nodes are hosts in the network
	- Edges are the communication links between them
- This paper states that *existing work fail to fully capture malware characteristics in their models*
- This paper is also quite fitted for their specific malware of choice
- *Based on the real WannaCry malware's behaviour, it showed that consecutive infection attempts from the same hosts are delayed by a variable time interval*
	- This is the concept behind the existence of a *"dormant" infected state*
	- Hosts will *temporarily cease to pass infection to their neighbours*
- In the context of a **network graph representation**:
	- defenders might be able to use a represented malware model to *configure its network topology by performing edge or node hardening*
- This model focuses on SPM propagation inside a local network rather than in a global context
- Assumes a "patient zero" concept, where it all spreads from one source
- Modeling self-propagating malware with epidemiological **models**
- ***Assumes that every machine can contact all others***
	- edge weights?
	- might actually have it, im not too sure
- Also assumes that machines cannot be infected twice
	- once malware is detected, it is immediately recovered
- *Contains very many other examples of other virus/epidemiological models*
	- Should read up on these to reference our own models
	- Also has examples on different malware for not just OS systems (like iOS and Android)
	- And even for external removable devices
- Uses these other papers to *directly compare against their own model in capturing self-propagating malware dynamics
- The infected dormant stat is included to capture the nature the malicious attacks
	- So, an infected node can become dormant for some period of time and resume its activity later
- ***Their training and simulation data is something that they produced themselves***
	- they ran it themselves in a controlled virtual environment
	- have not checked if this data is publicly available 
- rest was quite confusing/math/comparing their model to other standard models

### #3 Combining Epidemic Model and Deep Learning to Study Cyber Attacks
[Combining Epidemic Model and Deep Learning to Study Cyber Attacks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9447497)
- Uses an SEIAR compartmental model
	- Susceptible
	- Exposed
	- Infected
	- Asymptomatic
	- Recovered
- Set of differential equations which *usually* are solved using:
	- Euler Method
	- Crank-Nicolson Method
	- Runge-Kutta Method
- Similar to the previous ones, the model's neural network is build using one hidden layer
	- Advantages include usage of less storage compared to "traditional finite difference methods"
- Optimization methods mentioned include variations of BFGS:
	- Conjugate Gradient BFGS
	- Limited Memory BFGS
	- BFGS - **Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm**
- Introduction is a large preface to the new space of technology and its space
	- Introducing malware/malicious software to the reader
		- examples like trojan horses
- This paper also takes the *Artificial Neural Network approach
- Flow of this model is as follows
	- Susceptible devices enter a state of Exposed, which can now enter a state of being infected.
	- When it is infected, it can either be just infected or in an asymptomatic state.
		- Similar to the other papers' model
	- In this context, they are assumed to be infectious, but just at a reduced transmission rate
- *There is a theorem which any continuous function can be approximated by a feed-forward neural network with a hidden layer*
- The "convergence of the neural network" was done with three optimization methods
	- Conjugate Gradient Method                        (CG)
	- Broyden-Fretcher-Goldfard-Shanno method          (BFGS)
	- Limited Memory BFGS for Bound constrained method (L-BFGS-B)
	- In the paper, the BFGS showed the best results
- Additionally, the *Root Mean Squared Error* (RMSE) is used to compare the prediction errors in the model
	- The lower the RMSE, the more accurate the model is
- This is the paper which explains the **asymptomatic state** as a device that is carrying the virus without showing the symptoms (similar to how diseases spread in the human population)
