#### Von Neumann Architecture \[again]
- Memory is organized into addressable read/write storage locations
- Memory contains **both** instructions and data
- Program execution proceeds *sequentially*, occasionally branching
	- CPU controls the sequence and execution
#### Computer Organization
- ##### CPU
	- Contains three main components
		- **ALU \[Arithmetic Logic Unit]
			- Houses all the Arithmetic/Logic circuits
		- **Memory Unit
			- Houses the registers (data/address) for quick access
		- **CU \[Control Unit] 
			- Controls the communication between the program/operators, sending operations/instructions for the CPU to execute.
			- Is essentially the conductor of the CPU
