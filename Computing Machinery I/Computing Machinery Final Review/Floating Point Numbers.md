#### Floating Points
- To represent floating point numbers in assembly/binary, we use scientific notation
- To represent a number in scientific notation:
	- $\pm M * 2^{\pm E}$ 
	- where:
		- M is the Mantissa
		- E is the Exponent
		- 2 is the exponent base
	- To hold the number in binary, we use a 32 bit value (long)
		- 1st bit: 0/1 to indicate negative
			- signed magnitude
		- next 8 bits: biased exponent
			- the exponent is based so the "bias" is subtracted from the biased exponent to get the true exponent
			- for **k** bits, the bias is $(2^{k-1} - 1)$
				- for 8 bits the bias is 127
				- $e = e' - 127$
		- last 23 bits: normalized mantissa ("fraction")
- Exponent Range is:
	- True:
		- -126 to +127
	- Biased:
		- 1 to 254
- The normalized form a floating point number in binary is given by:
	- $\pm1.bbb...b*2^{\pm e}$
	- To normalize
		- move the decimal point to be the right of the most significant 1
		- adjust E accordingly
	- e.g.
		- $0.0110 * 2^5 \quad 1.10 * 2^3 \quad \text{shift 2 to the right}$
		- $101101 * 2^2 \quad 1.01101 * 2^7 \quad \text{shift 5 to the left}$
		- $101101 * 2^{-2} \quad 1.01101 * 2^3 \quad \text{shift 5 to the left}$
	- **Shifting left increases exponent by 1, shifting right decreases exponent by 1
- Since a normalized number always leads with 1, the MS Digit is implied, therefor not stored
