### Server-Side Development (IMPORTANT*)
- Everything in the course so far has been client-side
	- i.e. on the browser.
- of course, the browser requests content from a server
- The browser requests from the server 
	- which can be:
		- simple file requests
		- programs that must execute on the server
			- node, php, asp.net, etc.
- From around 1997 - 2012, most site content was programatically generated on the server
	- browser requests to server which executes a program that generates html which is returned to the browser.
- Nowadays, browsers dynamically generate content using data that was provided by the server.
	- browser requests to server which generates JSON which the browser will dynamically generate the content using that JSON
