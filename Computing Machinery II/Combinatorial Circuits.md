#### Preface
- Two types of circuits
	- *Combinatorial*
		- outputs are determined exclusively by current inputs
	- *Sequential*
		- outputs may be determined with previous outputs
- Block Diagram
	- **Diagram**: block diagram of combinational circuits with *m* inputs and *n* outputs
	- ***Each Output*** may be described by a boolean function with m inputs
- Any circuit can be built by composing combinational components is also combinational
	- composition must be without cycles
- To implement a basic computer, only a small number of fundamental combinational components are needed:
	- adders
	- decoders
	- encoders
	- multiplexers
- **Half Adder (HA)**
	- adds two bits (x, y)
	- to produce sum and carry bits (s, c)
	- See diagram in notes
- **Full Adder (FA)**
	- full adder adds three bits (x, y, c$_{in}$)
	- produces sum and carry bits (c$_{out}$, s)
	- Also in notes
- An *n-bit* adder can be obtained by combining one HA and **n-1** FA circuits
