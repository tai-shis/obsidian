### Characteristics of Sound
- **Frequency/Period**
	- Frequency
		- Unit of measure is a hertz (*Hz*)
	- Period
- **Amplitude**
	- Size of a the wave (*magnitude*)
	- Measure by taking peak and bottom and dividing by 2
- **Phase**
	- Shift of the starting position
	- not normally audible
	- But, *Important for the interactions between waves*
		- e.g.
			- sin() and cos() have the same wave form
			- cos()'s phase is +1 to sin() since it has the value 0 at 90Â°
- **Speed**
	- Not relevant for the course
	- But sound takes time to travel
	- *speed is different in different mediums*
		- e.g. water vs air

### Analog Audio Signals and Transducers
- **Transducers**
	- *converts energy from one form to another*
		- Speakers convert voltage to sound waves
		- Microphone convert sound waves to voltage
---
### Tone & Music
- Tone:
	- Particular frequency that can be heard
	- A named frequency
- Music:
	- combination of tones
	- each tone is *played* for a set duration
	- duration for each tone can vary

### Sound and Computers
- *Computers must store and process audio signals digitally*
- Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)
	- digital representation of an analog signal
	- Achieved by repeatedly sampling and quantizing the input signal
---
### PCM
- Amplitude of the analog signal is sampled at uniform intervals
	- Each sample is quantized to the nearest value within a range of digital steps
	- There will be a quantization bit depth (# of data bits)
	- There is an example of a sound wave being converted in the slides.
- **Headroom**
	- *difference between the top of the wave and the top increment
	- In the above example, the headroom is 0.
	- The amount of headroom can cause a loss of fidelity as not all bits are used.
		- i.e. accuracy of the sound "representation" to the real sound.
- The PCM is *not* as faithful reproduction of the analog signal
	- To increase the fidelity (accuracy), we can:
		- Increase the sample rate
		- Increase the quantization bit depth
- *Quantization Error*
	- the difference between the analog signal vs the digital representation of the signal
		- (the gap between the actual line vs the digital line)
	- the higher the fidelity rate, the smaller the quantization error.
- *Frequencies above 1/2 the sample rate will be distorted or lost *
	- So, at 32Hz, any sound above 16Hz will be lost.
- Encoding examples:
	- CDs:
		- 16-bit @ 44.1 kHz
		- So, the lost frequencies would be frequencies that humans cannot hear
		- Two channels (left, right)
		- noise to signal ratio from quantization is (supposedly) below the threshold of human hearing
	- DVDs:
		- 24-bit @ 192 kHz
		- raw data is *not* stored in PCM format
			- its compressed
			- *at least* than two channels
- **Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)**
	- circuit that converts and input analog signal to an output PCM signal
	- digital-to-analog converter (*DAC*) performs the reverse
	- PCM is a standard audio format for computers and digital communications
	- Examples:
		- WAV files
			- multi-format, usually contain uncompressed PCM data
		- "Lossy" formats
			- like mp3

### Sound Cards
- Sound card could be:
	- Expansion card, PCI card
	- Built-in to motherboard
	- USB device
	- etc.
- Includes at least one chip
	- Always includes a DAC
	- and sometimes an ADC
- Card will at least produce an analog audio signal from digital data such as PCM data
- **Ports/Connectors**
	- typical ports:
		- line out
			- 1/8" connector, maybe headphones or amp
		- line in
			- if input is supported
			- 1/8" jack too
		- mic in
			- similar to line in but for lower level signals which need amplification
		- S/PDIF port
			- for connecting digital components digitally
		- MIDI port
			- music import interface
			- musical instrument digital interface
	- typical functions:
		- playback and recording of PCM data
		- sound synthesis
		- mixing audio
		- effects
		- recording MIDI
- **When playing sound:**
	- outbound data *must often be double buffered*
		- sound card plays data in current buffer
		- next buffer of data will be prepared (uncompressing)
			- without this, it may create drops in sound
	- Increasing buffer size:
		- decreases the chance of a drop out
		- increases latency time

### Atari PSG Overview
- **Programmable Sound Generator**
	- produces analog audio signals
	- doesn't really play PCM data
	- has 16 8-bit registers
		- *mapped through two addresses*
			- one gives register select
			- PSG makes the selected register available at the second address
	- *3 channels A, B, C*
		- *each has 12-bit tuning (fine to coarse)*
		- A volume register
		- Each channel can be enabled/disabled independently
		- does not mix itself in output pins
			- this is done through external hardware
	- *Also a noise channel*
		- *5-bit tuning on a single register*
		- can be used for sound effects (like explosions)
