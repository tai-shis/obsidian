### Main Functional Units
- **CPU**
	- executes instructions
- **Main Memory**
	- Stores data and instructions
- **I/O Interfaces**
	- read from/write to outside world
- These are all connected by *busses*, and synchronized by a clock
- So:
	- CPU controls memory
	- CPU controls I/O
	- Memory control I/O
	- Input and Output control each other
		- e.g. networking (in directly to out)
- **I/O interface $\ne$ I/O device**
	- interface:
		- *digital circuit* that connects to an I/O device to a computer bus
	- device:
		- a device which translates information between the computer and environment
	- A device connects to a port which is the *interface* that communicates with the computer
	- A *computer* includes only the parts that communicates through the bus(ses)
		- CPU
		- RAM
		- etc.
	- A *computer system* is everything that communicates with/within the computer
		- Hard Drives
		- USB Devices
		- etc.
	- Expansion Card Slots (like PCIe) count as both, as they are interfaces, which connect to an interface
- Common Input/Output Devices
	- Keyboard/Mouse
		- Output from these could be feedback (LEDs/Vibration)
	- Printers
	- Modem
		- multidirectional
	- Hard Drives are considered I/O devices
	- Essentially all USB drives
