### Main Functional Units
- **CPU**
	- executes instructions
- **Main Memory**
	- Stores data and instructions
- **I/O Interfaces**
	- read from/write to outside world
- These are all connected by *busses*, and synchronized by a clock
- So:
	- CPU controls memory
	- CPU controls I/O
	- Memory control I/O
	- Input and Output control each other
		- e.g. networking (in directly to out)
- **I/O interface $\ne$ I/O device**
	- interface:
		- *digital circuit* that connects to an I/O device to a computer bus
	- device:
		- a device which translates information between the computer and environment
	- A device connects to a port which is the *interface* that communicates with the computer
	- A *computer* includes only the parts that communicates through the bus(ses)
		- CPU
		- RAM
		- etc.
	- A *computer system* is everything that communicates with/within the computer
		- Hard Drives
		- USB Devices
		- etc.
	- Expansion Card Slots (like PCIe) count as both, as they are interfaces, which connect to an interface
- Common Input/Output Devices
	- Keyboard/Mouse
		- Output from these could be feedback (LEDs/Vibration)
	- Printers
	- Modem
		- multi-directional
	- Hard Drives are considered I/O devices
	- Essentially all USB drives
- An I/O interface acts as a *buffer*
	- A buffer in this context is:
		- a temporary storage unit
		- accepts information at one rate and delivers it at another*
	- [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buffer)
	- e.g. A Storage Device
		- CPU Clock speeds vs Storage Read/Write speeds
- *Why is buffering important?*
	- speed differences
		- like above, clock speeds vs read/write speeds
	- data format differences (like serial vs parallel)
		- transmitting between the two different formats
	- sound
		- analog to digital data
	- etc.

### I/O Interfaces
- **Functions
	- communication with the CPU via a bus
	- communication with a device
	- data buffering
		- syncing faster functions to slower ones (faster reading vs writing)
	- error detection
		- so the computer can detect errors in the hardware properly
	- controlling/monitoring I/O operation/status
- A typical interface has various *onboard registers*
	- input/output registers (*essentially buffers*)
	- status registers
		- to monitor status (idle/not idle)
	- control registers
		- to control operation (disabling error detection when idle)
- The CPU should be able to *read/write to these registers*
	- This is how CPU can interact with an I/O interface
	- Access may be limited
		- e.g. why write to the input register of a keyboard?
- There are chip diagrams/examples in the slides. They are important.
	- Also context-specific details, kinda hard to describe
