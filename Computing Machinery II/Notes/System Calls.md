### Library Functions
- Compilers usually come with a *standard library* of functions/types to work with
- Simplifies things like:
	- I/O
	- String manipulation
	- Math
	- etc.
- Most Languages come with this
	- Java has stdlib, C has things like printf, sqrt, etc.
- These things are commonly used functions that are usually written in their own language. Also usually simplified so using them isn't difficult
	- Things like malloc and free are library functions
- Some programs are usually linked to a needed portion of the standard library.
	- *Usually the runtime environment functions*
