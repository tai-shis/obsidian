### Library Functions
- Compilers usually come with a *standard library* of functions/types to work with
- Simplifies things like:
	- I/O
	- String manipulation
	- Math
	- etc.
- Most Languages come with this
	- Java has stdlib, C has things like printf, sqrt, etc.
- These things are commonly used functions that are usually written in their own language. Also usually simplified so using them isn't difficult
	- Things like malloc and free are library functions
- Some programs are usually linked to a needed portion of the standard library.
	- *Usually the runtime environment functions*

### Operating System Responsibilities
- Responsibilities include:
	- *Managing System Hardware*
		- I/O devices
	- *Managing System Resources*
		- CPU time, memory
	- *Usually providing an environment for users*
		- GUI
	- ***Providing an environment for programs***
		- **A system call interface**
- Applications will communicate with the Operating System, which will then communicate to the Hardware.
- Communication is done through *SCIs*, which are doorways between the levels
- Pros/Cons in of each level:
	- **Low Level**
		- Pros:
			- Total Control
		- Cons:
			- Must know all Hardware details specific to the computer
			- Non-portable, limited to this device
	- **System Calls**
		- Pros:
			- More generic
			- Les detailed knowledge is needed
		- Cons:
			- Less control
			- Limited to the OS
	- **Library**
		- Pros:
			- Hardware and System *independent
			- Very portable
		- Cons:
			- Limited to what the library provides

### System Calls in C
- System calls can be invoked directly from C:
- **Beware of mixing *stdio library function calls* and *system calls* in the same program**
	- as it may cause unwanted behaviour
---
### TOS Organization
- TOS has several levels of system call
	- GEMDOS:         generic, hardware-independent SCI
		- trap #1, contains basic i/o, file system, date/time, etc.
	- BIOS and XBIOS: hardware-dependent, ST-specific SCI
		- trap #13, lower level things
		- trap #14, low level, and st-specific (like sound)
	- LINE A:         primitive graphics (and mouse) operations
		- different technique, can plot pixels, lines, etc.
	- GEM:            GUI Layer
