#### Preface
- Two types of circuits
	- *Combinatorial*
		- outputs are determined exclusively by current inputs
	- *Sequential*
		- outputs may be determined with previous outputs
- Block Diagram
	- **Diagram**: block diagram of combinational circuits with *m* inputs and *n* outputs
	- ***Each Output*** may be described by a boolean function with m inputs
- Any circuit can be built by composing combinational components is also combinational
	- composition must be without cycles
- To implement a basic computer, only a small number of fundamental combinational components are needed:
	- adders
	- decoders
	- encoders
	- multiplexers
- **Half Adder (HA)**
	- adds two bits (x, y)
	- to produce sum and carry bits (s, c)
	- See diagram in notes
- **Full Adder (FA)**
	- full adder adds three bits (x, y, c$_{in}$)
	- produces sum and carry bits (c$_{out}$, s)
	- Also in notes
- An *n-bit* adder can be obtained by combining one HA and **n-1** FA circuits
- A basic method is by ripple carry.
	- however, ripple carry for larger sizes of arithmetic is too slow
		- can be done using carry-lookahead
- **Decoder**
	- n-bit value represents $2^n$ distinct values
	- not all output lines are required to be connected
	- e.g. a 1x2 decoder has one input and two outputs
		- if the input is zero. the first output is active,
		- if the input is one, the second output is active
		- diagram is self-explanatory.
- **Encoders**
	- inverse operation of a decoder
	- has $2^n$ inputs and up to n outputs
	- *Priority Encoder*
		- multiple inputs may be active simultaneously
		- output will correspond to the *highest* numbered input
		- determined using **Karnaugh maps**
			- will not be tested
- **Multiplexer**
	- if both items try to write to the bus at the first time, *one will get to the line first*
		- voltage flowing on the wire to the second item is in the wrong direction
		- can cause shorts and possibly damage components
		- outputs of two gates must not be connected
	- the **MUX** or multiplexor is used to decide which input will be used
	- Two ways to implement n-input boolean function using a $2^n x 1$ MUX
- **ROMs**
	- *Read-Only-Memory*
	- is a combinational component
	- a x b means it has
		- a addresses
		- with b bit values stored at each location
	- $log_2a$ inputs -> the address of a memory location
	- b outputs   -> the value stored at the location
	- each output bit is a *boolean function* of the address bit
		- has 1/0 at that specific address
	- Address and data size are *unrelated*
	- Can be generalized to $2^n$ to m ROM 
- **ALUs**
	- Since we can build an n-bit adder/subtractor out of Full adders.
	- Can be generalized to $(n+1)-bit$ ALU
	- *All possible operations in an ALU are performed regardless of what the desired operation is*
		- *Desired operation is decided by the **MUX***
